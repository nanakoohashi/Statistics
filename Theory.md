# Statistics Background
## Measures of Center
### Arithmetic Mean
= Mean = Average  
= âˆ‘x/N

#### Advantages
Most accurate measure of center in a dataset without outliers.

#### Disadvantages
Influenced by outliers.

### Outlier
A data value that is either much greater than or much less than the rest of the data and not representative of the rest of the data being considered.

### Median
- Middle value in the sorted list of data values.  
= (N+1)/2  
  - N = number of items in the list
  - If no single middle exists, find the mean between the two middle items.

#### Advantages
Not influenced by outliers.

#### Disadvantages
In a dataset without outliers, a less accurate measure of center.

### Mode
- The most frequently occurring value.
- Much less commonly used than mean and median.
*e.g. The mode of 1, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 9 is 8, because 8 appears more times than any other value. *

## Measures of Spread
### Minimum, Maximum, Range
- Measures of Center **does not** indicate the **spread** of data values.
- A simple measure of spread is to report the **minimum** and **maximum** values as well as the **range**.
### Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
- The mean of the absolute difference between each value and the value's mean.
- Absolute values (magnitudes) are used to avoid negative distances.
### Variance and Standard Deviation
- **Variance**: Squares the difference between each value and value's mean.
- **Standard deviation**: The square root of the variance.

## Histograms
### Histogram with evenly-sized bins
#### Frequency Distribution
A table that displays how often an outcome occurs for a sample.
- **Construction**: The data set is divided into mutally exclusive classes.
- **Class**: A value of a categorical variable OR an interval of a continuous variable.
