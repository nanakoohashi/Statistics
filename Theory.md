# Statistics Background
## Measures of Center
### Arithmetic Mean
= Mean = Average  
= âˆ‘x/N

#### Advantages
Most accurate measure of center in a dataset without outliers.

#### Disadvantages
Influenced by outliers.

### Outlier
A data value that is either much greater than or much less than the rest of the data and not representative of the rest of the data being considered.

### Median
- Middle value in the sorted list of data values.  
= (N+1)/2  
  - N = number of items in the list
  - If no single middle exists, find the mean between the two middle items.

#### Advantages
Not influenced by outliers.

#### Disadvantages
In a dataset without outliers, a less accurate measure of center.

### Mode
- The most frequently occurring value.
- Much less commonly used than mean and median.
*e.g. The mode of 1, 4, 4, 8, 8, 8, 9 is 8, because 8 appears more times than any other value. *

## Measures of Spread
### Minimum, Maximum, Range
